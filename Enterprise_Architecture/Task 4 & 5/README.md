# Portfoli Deliverable - Enterprise Architecture -

This directory contains a JAVA file. The project was used to deploy the model to Camunda Workflow Engine and to test using JUnit test. 

About JUnit Testing: 
To test the deployed model, Junit tests were done. The tests were coped to be a behaviour test or interaction test. The unit test file had different methods and they were called to see if the test passed or failed. While the behaviour test did not validate the result, it was able to check if the input parameters were correct and the implementation was done properly.
